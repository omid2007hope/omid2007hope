### Hi there 👋
Disciplined frontend dev building clean, fast, and reliable web apps. I ship polished UIs with React + Tailwind, and I am leveling up on the backend (Node.js, databases) to grow into a full-stack engineer.

---

### Core Focus
- Frontend craft: React, modern JavaScript, accessible UI, smooth UX
- Performance + quality: component architecture, state management, testing mindset
- Deployments: Nginx on Ubuntu, CI/CD basics, observability curiosity
- Growth path: backend fundamentals (Node/Express, SQL/NoSQL) and cloud readiness

---

### Toolbox
**Languages & Frameworks:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS, Redux, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
**Design & Product:** Figma, Adobe Illustrator, UX polish, microcopy awareness  
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, Postman, VS Code, npm/yarn, basic CI/CD workflows  
**Learning Now:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

---

### Highlighted Projects
**Velora E-Commerce** — React + Tailwind, Google Sign-In, LocalStorage session handling, dynamic checkout (shipping/tax/order summary), responsive UI.  
**Personal Portfolio** — Responsive React + Tailwind, deployed on Ubuntu 22.04 with Nginx, smooth animations and clean UX.  
**Task Manager (WIP)** — Frontend in React; evolving into full-stack with Node, moving from LocalStorage to a real database.

---

### Current Priorities
- Sharpen React ecosystem expertise (performance, DX, testing)
- Build production-ready Node services and database skills
- Strengthen deployment, CI/CD, and cloud know-how
- Prepare for professional frontend roles in Austria and beyond
